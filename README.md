# SQL - Reflection
Learning about databases and SQL seems simple yet complicated. The whole GUI for SQL Studio isnt my favorite, I ran into some issues installing and getting everything just ready to work. The UI is pretty archaeic compared to the IDE's we have been working with. I also learned during this process that my computer nativley comes with sqlite3, so that was cool. I learned how helpful this can ben on the macro level with large quantities of data.I still need to get used to it though, while troubleshooting I saw that VSCode can manipulate DB files so maybe I will play around with taht at some point.
